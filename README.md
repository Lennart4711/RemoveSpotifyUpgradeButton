# RemoveSpotifyUpgradeButton
It does exactly what it says. Nothing more, nothing less. <br>
You can install it via the firefox addon store [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/removespotifyupgradebutton/)

The code is in content.js for those who want to take a look at it. The performance loss using this extension is pretty much none, I measured around 15Î¼s.

If something is not working or you have a feature suggestion or if you have any questions just create an issue.
